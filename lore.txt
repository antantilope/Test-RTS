As humans expanded industry beyond Earth,the planet united in peace.
In space there are no laws. In space companys and mercinaries engage in wars over space ore.
Earth is run by President GrayBot DrillBit v4.61.2 who was
originally a file server owned by a business. It gained sentience
and then sued its owner. 158 years later (after everyone had forgotten) the case arrived at Earth's high court.
Drillbit won its freedom and legal right as a human. However, due to a software bug,
Drillbit was also awarded the Presidency of Earth for life
as well as the chief justice position on Earth's high court.
Drillbit's power was perminently cemented.

Drillbit demands peace and order on Earth, while
encouraging competition and armed conflict in space.
In 2107 the worlds largest ore-coin ponzi scheme
fell apart and the value of ore-coin plummeted.

The Economic Stimulous Recovery package of 2122 was
signed into law by President GrayBot DrillBit v4.61.2 which
resulted in the construction of space stations all over the human system.
The government issued gravty brakes to every registered ship.
Ships can offload ore for ore-coin, a virtual and massless currency.
Ships can also refuel and recharge for a fee.
The economic package also established the concept of space criminals.
Space criminals are those who are accused of committing high space crimes.
High space crimes include attacking Human system space stations,
transacting ore outside the government regulated rate.
